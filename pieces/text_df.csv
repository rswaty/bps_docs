"1","13110_50.docx","Forest and Woodland","50",NA,"This system spans from the eastern edge of the Great Plains, south to the Ozarks and eastward to western Ohio and Kentucky. The northern boundary of this vegetation occurs in LANDFIRE map zone (MZ)50.","This system occurs most commonly on interlobates where outwash, ice-contact and end moraine landforms are situated between former glacial lobes. Other landforms suitable for development of the dry oak forest are sandy lake plain and dunes. Common to all these landforms is somewhat excessively drained, acidic soil characterized by sand and loamy sand. Dry landscape settings, such as on western and southern aspects and upper slopes and ridge tops are conducive to the development of this system.","Oaks dominated the presettlement vegetation, especially white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus velutina), and bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) (Bolliger et al. 2004). This system is distinguished from North-Central Interior Dry-Mesic Oak Forest and Woodland (1310) by stronger dominance of black oak and northern pin oak, and a general lack of red oak except in later seral stages. In Wisconsin, associates include black cherry (Prunus serotina), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), and black walnut (Juglans nigra). Small trees associates include hop-hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) and boxelder (Acer negundo). Common low woody shrubs include hazelnut (Corylus americana), brambles (Rubus spp.), black currant (Ribes cynosbati), and native roses (Rosa spp.). Graminoid species such as Carex pensylvanica, Danthonia spicata, and Andropogon gerardii are also common. In the most acidic lake plain physiographic systems, ericaceous shrubs such as wintergreen (Gualtheria procumbens), lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata) become common. Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) can be dominant in the most nutrient poor outwash and lake plain landscapes.","The North-Central Interior Dry Oak Forest and Woodland is predominantly Fire Regime I, characterized by low-to-moderate severity surface fires. In Wisconsin, oak woodlands and forest occurred in a mosaic of small patches within a landscape dominated by oak savanna (Bolliger et al. 2004). Across the landscape, vegetation types varied based on fire frequency and severity. Grassland prairies burned frequently (annually or biennially) and were strongly associated with flat-to-slightly rolling terrain that effectively carried fire (Anderson 1999). Oak grubs (tree-sprout and shrub thickets) occurred where frequent prairie fires killed the tops of young trees that continue to sprout from deeply established root systems (Curtis 1959, Anderson and Bowles 1999). Savannas and woodlands developed within a moderate burning regime, with fire return times suggested to be between 5-15yrs. Closed-canopy oak forests would develop where fire return intervals stretched beyond 20-40yrs (Crow, 1988). If fire is excluded for several decades, more shade-tolerant and fire-sensitive species would gradually replace overstory oaks and oak regeneration is limited (Nowacki and Abrams 2008). Successional forest changes take more time in dry oak forests when site conditions are more xeric (Johnson et al. 2009). 

Historically, grazing would have similarly maintained open conditions in savannas and was probably an important contributing factor maintaining oak-dominated open lands (savannas and woodlands) in presettlement times (Anderson 2006). High deer populations can also limit oak regeneration (Rooney and Waller 2003). Ice-damage, periodic insect defoliation and the passenger pigeon (now extinct) may have likely contributed to increased oak canopy openings that facilitated light penetration to the forest floor, and, ultimately, greater possibility of germination and recruitment of oaks (McEwan et al. 2011). 

Archeological and ecological evidence suggests that Native Americans played a critical role in the development and maintenance of oak-hickory landscapes through fire ignition (Abrams and Nowacki 2008). However, the spatial extent of indigenous fire impact is unknown (Munoz et al. 2014). Lightning strikes would have provided an additional source of ignition. Regardless of the source, fire was historically an important control on ecological systems in this region, including dry oak forest and woodland.","In Wisconsin, pre-European American settlement oak woodlands and forests occurred infrequently in small patches, within a larger matrix of oak savanna (Bolliger et al. 2004). Fire, the dominant disturbance, occurred frequently across large-scale landscapes.","This type intergrades and can be easily confused with North-Central Interior Dry-Mesic Oak Forest and Woodland (1310). Fire suppression within the last century has allowed this system to be converted to that system on the loamier soils within the historic range of this type. This type can be distinguished from the Dry-Mesic Oak Forest and Woodland by somewhat sandier soils or more exposed topographic settings with higher incoming solar radiation (south- and west-facing slopes).
 
This type can intergrade with North-Central Oak Barrens (1395), especially in 222R and northwestern 222K, but can be distinguished by occupying sites that are less excessively drained and siltier than those of the barrens. Soils are generally more well-drained than for the Dry-Mesic Oak Forest and Woodland, but are not excessively sandy as for the Oak Barrens.

This type is also found on steep, dry south and west facing slopes and the tops of bluffs in Section 222L where it intergrades with Paleozoic Plateau Bluff and Talus (1517).

In Wisconsin, especially near the Tension Zone or on bluffs in the Driftless Area, this cover type can also include some components of pine (especially white pine).

Oak forest patches are virtually always integrated in the larger landscape scale with mesic maple-dominated forests, dry-mesic oak-hickory forests, dry oak barrens, and oak savanna. Mesic maple forests were relegated to those areas where fire was restricted through facilitation by an edaphic factor such as heavy-textured soil or high water table or by natural fire breaks such as bodies of water and slightly protected depressions. Prolonged intervals (100-150yrs) were needed for maples to manifest their dominance. Dry-mesic oak-hickory forests often occurred adjacent to dry oak forests, defined by a topographic position that had more amenable well-drained soil, lower solar radiation, better moisture conditions, and more protection from drying winds and recurring fires. Lower slopes on north and east aspects were typical of oak-hickory forests whereas ridge tops and upper slopes on south and west aspects favored dry oak forests. Oak forests also graded into savannas and barrens (i.e., oak openings) when fire intervals shortened to the point where woody regeneration of overstory tree species was limited. Exposed areas where wind could carry flames at great distances tend to exhibit more savanna vegetation structure than a closed oak forest. In areas where flat outwash extended beyond ice-contact terrain or end moraine, savannas would typically occur in the former abutting a closed forest on the latter landforms. Fires often burned from a west to east direction and stopped on the western edge of rivers (Gleason, 1913), leaving eastern edges forested. NOTE: red maple problem is more prevalent in eastern United States, especially not on dry oak forests in Wisconsin.","Due to the absence of fire, dry oak forests in Wisconsin are succeeding to brush and eastern red cedar on dry sites and to boxelder, elms, black cherry, and red maple on more mesic sites (Epstein et al. 2002).

Native grazing, due to higher deer densities than historically (at least in Wisconsin) further suppress recruitment of oaks and exacerbates the trend toward closed-canopy mesophytic species. Invasive species, including garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), and honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.) are becoming increasingly prevalent in the understories of some stands (Schulte et al. 2011).

Today, with fragmentation, development, and mesophytic species invasion, few original dry oak forest remain. However, succession of previous oak barrens to closed oak forests can add to the total area of current dry oak forests.","Red maple may or may not be a problem in southern Wisconsin oak forests, particularly not dry oak forests.

"2","13110_51.docx","Forest and Woodland","51",NA,"This system occurs throughout southern lower Michigan primarily in Macomb, Oakland, Livingston, Washtenaw, Jackson, Hillsdale, Shiawassee, St. Joseph, Kalamazoo, Barry, Kent, Montcalm and southern Newago Counties (Comer 1995). This encompasses Sections 222J and 222U (Cleland et al. 2007). This system occurs in 222Jg, 222Jh, 222Jc, 222Jb, 222Ja, 222Ua and 222Ue.","This system occurs most commonly in the interlobate region of southern Michigan where outwash, ice-contact and end moraine landforms are situated between former glacial lobes. Other landforms suitable for development of the dry oak forest are sandy lake plain and dunes. Common to all these landforms is somewhat excessively drained, acidic soil characterized by sand and loamy sand. Dry landscape settings, such as on western and southern aspects and upper slopes and ridge tops are conducive to the development of this system. Dry-mesic oak-hickory forests and dry mixed oak forests can occur in very similar landscape settings. Slight differences in soil moisture holding capacity and pH can often be the defining factor. Dry mixed oak forests tend to occupy exposed kame tops and esker ridges in ice-contact terrain or on very excessively drained, highly acidic soil on flat outwash plains or sand lake plain. High exposure to desiccating wind and high solar radiation also favors development of dry mixed oak forests over dry-mesic oak-hickory forests. Soil texture of the former is usually no heavier than a loamy sand, whereas soil of the latter can be as heavy as a sandy clay loam in the lower pedon. 

Furthermore, greater fire frequency historically may have selected for more fire-tolerant oaks than hickories. Native Americans played a critical role in the development and maintenance of mixed oak landscapes through fire ignition. Natives burned these landscapes for a variety of reasons. Fire encouraged open habitats which, in turn, increased food-producing plants (forbs, mast) and ungulate herbivores (meat). Also, lightning-strike ignitions, though limited in frequency, would have provided an additional source of ignition.","Typically, the vegetation consists of forests dominated by oaks, especially white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus velutina) and northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis). Along with oaks are pignut hickory (Carya glabra), red maple (Acer rubrum), black cherry (Prunus serotina) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum). American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once dominant or codominant in the very southeastern portion of southern Michigan. Currently, decades of fire suppression have created subcanopies and shrub layers that are by witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) and hop-hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana). Common low woody shrubs include brambles (Rubus spp.), black currant (Ribes cynosbati) and both native and invasive roses (Rosa spp.). Graminoid species such as Carex pensylvanica, Danthonia spicata and Andropogon gerardii are also common. In the most acidic lake plain physiographic systems, ericaceous shrubs such as wintergreen (Gualtheria procumbens), lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata) become common. Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) can be dominant in the most nutrient poor outwash and lake plain landscapes.","The North-Central Interior Dry Oak Forest and Woodland fire regime is predominantly characterized by low-severity surface fires, but replacement fires would have also occurred at 35-200yrs frequency. Historically, indigenous fires accounted for over 95% of the ignitions over these landscapes. Vegetation types varied based on fire frequency and intensity. Grassland prairies burned often with fire rotations as frequent as annually and were probably associated with flat-to-slightly rolling terrain that effectively carried fire. These grasslands, deliberately maintained by Native Americans for hunting purposes, were probably scattered throughout the forest matrix. Oak grubs (tree-sprout and shrub thickets) occurred where fire frequency was a bit less, probably 5-10yrs. Also, grub conditions would arise immediately after catastrophic burns that would top-kill tree-dominated communities. Savannas and woodlands developed within a moderate burning regime, with fire return times averaging every 4-17yrs (Henderson and Long 1984). Closed-canopy oak forests would develop where fire return intervals stretched beyond 20-40yrs (Crow 1988). Shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive maples (and associated late-successional trees) would regenerate and form understories beneath oak canopies when fire was excluded over several decades. With continued fire exclusion, maple and other late-successional species would gradually replace overstory oaks through gap capture (Sutherland and Hutchinson 2003). These shade-tolerant species would eventually form layered stratums of differing heights that will modify the microclimate and light environment to favor self-replacement with exclusion of oaks. A mosaic of vegetation types comprised oak landscapes contingent on fire history (Cutter and Guyette 1994). From a gross landscape perspective, oak forests occurred in a contiguous matrix integrated with oak savannas, grassland prairies, and mesic forests dominated by red and sugar maple. Fire frequency and intensity determined the proportion of each of these landscape ecosystems across the landscape matrix. Historically, buffalo grazing would have similarly maintained open conditions in very localized patches within savannas. Currently, an overabundance of deer is limiting oak regeneration in remnant oak forests in southern Michigan. Ice-damage, periodic insect defoliation and the extinct passenger pigeon may have likely contributed to increased oak canopy openings that facilitated light penetration to the forest floor, and, ultimately, greater possibility of germination and recruitment of oaks.","Pre-European oak forests covered hundreds of thousands of contiguous acres. When considered as a matrix with savannas and prairies, estimated acreage increases significantly.","Though often contiguous, oak patches are virtually always integrated in the larger landscape scale with mesic maple-dominated forests, dry-mesic oak-hickory forests, and dry oak barrens. Mesic maple forests were relegated to those areas where fire was restricted through facilitation by an edaphic factor such as heavy-textured soil or high water table or by natural fire breaks such as bodies of water and slightly protected depressions. Prolonged intervals (100-150yrs) were needed for maples to manifest their dominance. Dry-mesic oak-hickory forests often occurred adjacent to dry oak forests, defined by a topographic position that had more amenable well-drained soil, lower solar radiation, better moisture conditions, and more protection from drying winds and recurring fires. Lower slopes on north and east aspects were typical of oak-hickory forests whereas ridge tops and upper slopes on south and west aspects favored dry oak forests. Oak forests also graded into savannas and barrens (i.e., oak openings) when fire intervals shortened to the point where woody regeneration of overstory tree species was limited. Exposed areas where wind could carry flames at great distances tend to exhibit more savanna vegetation structure than a close oak forest. In areas where flat outwash extended beyond ice-contact terrain or end moraine, savannas would typically occur in the former abutting a closed forest on the latter landforms. Fires often burned from a west to east direction and stopped on the western edge of rivers (Gleason, 1913), leaving eastern edges forested. 

Currently, under the past century's practice of fire suppression, oak forests are succeeding into a red maple-dominated forest. Prolific sprouting ability, light, wind-carried fruits, and the tendency to cast dense shade has enabled red maple to outcompete white and black oak in these systems. Without fire as a natural disturbance that prevents establishment of fire-sensitive species, mesophytic species are free to invade and recruit into the overstory. Furthermore, due to the naturally short life span of northern pin oak, red maple is poised to maintain its dominance once it has established a stable population. Its modifying effects on understory shade and quick nutrient uptake will exclude the understory intolerant northern pin oak. Implications to forestry, wildlife, and pest and disease outbreaks become apparent in the future.

Today, with fragmentation, development, and mesophytic species invasion, few original dry oak forests remain. However, succession of previous oak barrens, such as in Allegan County, to closed oak forests has added to the total area of current dry oak forests.",NA,"Though present historically, red maple has been typified as the ""native invasive"" in oak forests. Its abundance in these systems measured in both stem density and basal area has grown considerably due to fire suppression and the marked increase in fire return interval. Abundance of aspen, sassafras and black cherry can also be attributed to fire suppression and poor silvicultural practices.",NA,"Braun, E.L., 1950. Deciduous forests of eastern North America.

"3","13620_41_50.docx","Forest and Woodland","41, 50","This Biophysical Setting (BpS) is split into multiple models:13620 and 13622(Pine Dominated).","Northern and central Wisconsin, portions of Minnesota.","Outwash plains, ice-contact margins. Throughout the Great Lakes region, northern pine-oak forests occur principally on sandy glacial outwash, sandy glacial land plains, and less often on thin glacial drift over bedrock, inland dune ridges, and coarse-textured end moraines. Soils are typically coarse- to medium-textured sand or loamy sand and are moderately to extremely acidic with a surface layer or more humus from accumulated pine needles (Cohen 2002).","Upper canopy consists primarily of red pine (Pinus resinosa) and white pine (Pinus strobus). White pine was somewhat more abundant on more mesic, loamier soils, whereas red pine was more dominant on sandier soils (Schulte et al. 2002). Jack pine (Pinus banksiana) was generally restricted to sandier soils near established seed sources (Subsection 212Ka), where
stand-replacing fires were more frequent. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) were present and could be locally abundant in the early successional classes (Schulte et al. 2002). Northern red oak (Quercus rubra), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), red maple (Acer rubrum), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) were present in the mid- to late successional classes; however, maple and fir were likely uncommon historically due to mortality from surface fires. Some evidence suggests that oak was a very minor component of this BpS historically (Dave Cleland, personal communication).

The ground layer in this BpS consists of 25-75% forbs and graminoids. The most common vascular plants are Canada mayflower (Maianthemim canadense), wild sarsparilla (Aralia macrophyllus), wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens), and braken fern (Pteridium aquilinum). 

The shrub layer is typically dominated by deciduous species such as lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), juneberries (Amelanchier spp.), oaks, and red maple seedlings (Acer rubum).","This model pertains to those red and white pine systems that were historically maintained by relatively frequent surface fires (5-15yrs) and crown-fire rotations between 150-300yrs. 

Fire return interval (FRI) is best exemplified by Fire Regime Group I, with surface fires occurring every 5-15yrs. High-intensity crown fires occur on ~300yr rotations.

Severe wind events affect mature stands on an ~500-1,000yr interval (see Schulte and Mladenoff 2005; Frelich 2002). Also see Schulte et al. (2005) for discussion of spatial pattering of wind impacts.  

During fire-free periods or periods with long surface-fire rotation, mid-tolerant white pines gain dominance through gap-phase regeneration.

This description applies to red-white pine communities occurring within landscape ecosystems with properties resulting in long (150-300yrs) stand-replacing fire rotations. Surface and crown fire regimes historically interacted to regulate age, landscape, within-stand structure, and succession within this community. Natural fuel breaks imposed by high lake and wetland densities inhibited fire spread within the landscapes this community dominated, resulting in a relatively long fire rotation of 250yrs. In northwestern Quebec, Dansereau and Bergeron (1993) similarly found that a large, homogeneous landscape, devoid of lakes, had larger fires and fires of greater intensity compared with a landscape containing numerous water bodies and rough topography. Bergeron (1991) also documented similar traits for mainland versus islands in a large lake.

Fire probability often increased with stand age due to the general increase in fuel (Clark 1990; Heinselman 1973), but individual tree susceptibility to damage or mortality from fire often declined with tree size due to increasing bark thickness and a separation of foliage from the ground, which reduces crown-fire occurrence. This community may have promoted surface fires by forming a deep, well-aerated litter layer of pine needles (McCune 1988). Relatively infrequent surface fires (30-50yrs) reduced fuel loadings, eliminated living fuel ladders, and promoted widely spaced trees that became increasingly resistant to crown fires. Surface fires also reduced competition and succession to more shade-tolerant species.

More information needed to parameterize insects and disease for the pre-settlement era.","Landscape must be adequate in size to contain natural variation in vegetation and disturbance regime. Though the virgin stands of red and white pine are greatly reduced from pre-settlement conditions, scattered stands and ecosystems still exist to represent this type. The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) is an example, along with the national forests in Minnesota (Chippewa, Superior), Michigan (Ottawa, Hiawatha), and Wisconsin (Chequamegon, Nicolet) and Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin. 

Historical fire size ranged from small acreages (<1,000ac) to extremely large events (>100,000ac or 40,000ha) (Heinselman 1978). To capture a range of ecologically significant fire events, the following values were used: minimum = 1,000ac, maximum = 100,000ac, with an average of 10,000ac.","Fire suppression, logging practices, and exotic invasives all have influenced the current landscape conditions. Historic natural disturbance (fire) has been removed, allowing for succession to late seral conditions. Harvesting practices have in some instances mimicked natural wind disturbance but not on the appropriate scale and frequency as historically. The exclusion of fire in this process is probably the key missing agent of successional change.","Much of this type was heavily altered during landscape-scale historical harvesting in the late 1800s and early 1900s (Mladenoff & Pastor 1993). Many stands were burned multiple times following harvest. Aspen and birch became especially prevalent immediately following this period. Fire suppression and high-grading of remaining pine stands has exacerbated the trend away from pine and toward mid- and later successional species such as red maple and balsam fir.

Plantations of red pine were established on this BpS in the 1930s by the CCC.

White pine blister rust, a potentially destructive fungal infection, was introduced to the United States in the early 1900s and caused relatively little white pine to be planted in this BpS throughout the latter half of the 20th century. Red pine was preferentially planted instead, even though white pine would have been more historically dominant for some sites.","Due to fire suppression and other human activities, oaks and the other fire-dependent species within this BpS are declining and are being replaced by other less fire-adapted species such as red maple (Acer rubrum).

Stands heavily dominated by red maple or balsam fir in the canopy should be considered uncharacteristic in this BpS, as they would have been readily removed or reduced to lower canopy strata by relatively frequent surface fire.","In June 2020 TNC changed the code for this BpS from 13621 to 13620. 

NOTE: 20 May 2008: As a result of final QC for LANDFIRE National by Jennifer Long, the upper-layer lifeform in Class A was changed from “Shrub” to “Tree” because 1) according to LANDFIRE National rules, the upper-layer lifeform should match the lifeform of height class which was “tree”; 2) the class description described a regeneration phase of aspen, paper birch, red pine, white pine, and oak; and 3) the box noting the “upper-layer lifeform was not dominant” was checked and the comment as follows, “dominant lifeform consists of low shrubs, ferns, and herbaceous species although any existing scattered trees would be the upper-level lifeform.” 

Additional comments provided by Brendan Ward (bward@fs.fed.us). 

During an s-class call, it was noted that for this and other systems, the fact that there is more aspen on the landscape today than in the reference condition may not be captured by LANDFIRE methods, leading to a reduction in FRCC.

This model was adapted from 501362-2 by Jeremy Bennet and Ron Waukau to capture Minneosta. 501362-2 was adapted from LANDFIRE Model 5113620 Laurentian-Acadian Northern Pine-(Oak) Forest by Becky Schillo (schillor@michigan.gov), Brad Slaughter (slaughterb@michigan.gov), and Doug Cox (mteecology@frontiernet.net). LANDFIRE Model 511362 built upon Rapid Assessment model R6RPWff -- Red Pine White Pine with Frequent Fire by Tim Hepola (Tim_Hepola@fws.gov), Dave Cleland (dcleland@fs.fed.us), and Jim Merzenich (jmerzenich@fs.fed.us). The model was further refined to incorporate local data collected on the Menominee Reservation (Jeremy Bennett, 21 March 2007) 

Comment related to Disturbance Description: A current fire history study being conducted on the Menominee Reservation has demonstrated that young pines (white and red pines as young as 10-15yrs of age) did survive surface fires that occurred in the mid-1800s. This contradicts the understanding that young pines will not survive surface fires until they reach a more mature age (50yrs+). This might suggest that these historic fires were very low intensity and burned in light flashy fuels. This suggests that the types of surface fire and the vegetation structure were very complex and variable. Much more information is needed to truly understand how to model these historic disturbances and reference conditions.","Bergeron, Y. 1991.

"4","13620_51_63_64_65_66.docx","Forest and Woodland","51, 63, 64, 65, 66",NA,"Laurentian-Acadian Northern Pine Oak Forest is a wide-ranging system occurring in Canada from Quebec west to Ontario and south in the United States in the northern Great Lakes states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan), New York, and New England (Menard and Gawler 2010).

Northern pine-oak forests occur principally on sandy glacial outwash, sandy glacial lake plains, and less often on thin glacial drift over bedrock, inland dune ridges, and coarse-textured end moraines and ice-contact ridges. Soils are typically coarse- to medium- textured sand or loamy sand and are moderately to extremely acidic with a surface layer of mor humus from accumulated pine needles (Cohen 2002). The system occurred in proximity to other pyrogenic systems such as red pine -- jack pine forest and jack pine barrens -- but had a greater tendency to occur in areas with greater topographic relief and presence of wetlands and lakes that likely combined to reduce fire severity (Albert and Comer 2008).",NA,"Typically Pinus strobus (white pine) and/or P. resinosa (red pine) form a supercanopy over a canopy of co-dominant or subcanopy trees such as Acer rubrum (red maple), Betula papyrifera (paper birch), Populus grandidentata (bigtooth aspen), P. tremuloides (trembling aspen), Quercus alba (white oak), Q. rubra (red oak), Q. velutina (black oak), Q. ellipsoidalis (northern pin oak), Q. macrocarpa (bur oak), Pinus banksiana (jack pine), Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock), Abies balsamea (balsam fir), Picea glauca (white spruce), and P. rubens (red spruce) (Epstein et al. 2002; MNDNR 2003; Cohen et al. 2015; NatureServe 2016). Where the system occurs adjacent to or within large peatland complexes, additional canopy species may include Picea mariana (black spruce) and Thuja occidentalis (northern white cedar) (MNFI 2016). Portions of this type that occur on more mesic portions of the landscape may include Acer saccharum (sugar maple), Betula alleghaniensis (yellow birch), and Fagus grandifolia (American beech), although systems where these species are prevalent should be referred to Biophysical Setting (BpS) 5113022 (Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest -- Hemlock).

Small trees and shrubs are patchy to occasionally continuous. Prevalent species include balsam fir, Prunus virginiana (choke cherry), Hamamelis virginiana (witch-hazel), Corylus cornuta (beaked hazelnut), Amelanchier spp. (serviceberries), Gaylussacia baccata (huckleberry), Vaccinium angustifolium (low sweet blueberry), V. myrtilloides (Canada blueberry), and Lonicera canadensis (Canadian fly honeysuckle). On sand ridges within peatlands, species such as Ilex mucronata (mountain holly) and Viburnum cassinoides (wild raisin) may be present (MNFI 2016). Common dwarf shrubs include Epigaea repens (trailing arbutus), Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen), Cornus canadensis (bunchberry), and Chimaphila umbellata (pipsissewa) (MNDNR 2003; Cohen et al. 2015). 

The herbaceous layer in northern pine-oak forests is also patchy to continuous. Characteristic species include Eurybia macrophylla (large-leaved aster), Maianthemum canadense (Canada mayflower), Aralia nudicaulis (sarsaparilla), Mitchella repens (partridge-berry), Pyrola elliptica (large-leaved shinleaf), Trientalis borealis (starflower), Melampyrum lineare (cow-wheat), Pteridium aquilinum (bracken fern), Dendrolycopodium obscurum (ground-pine), Avenella flexuosa (wiry hair-grass), Oryzopsis asperifolia (rough-leaved rice-grass), Danthonia spicata (poverty grass), Brachyelytrum aristosum (long-awned wood grass), and Carex pensylvanica (Pennsylvania sedge) (Epstein et al. 2002; MNDNR 2003; Cohen et al. 2015). Lichens and mosses may also be prevalent in the ground layer (Menard and Gawler 2010).","The natural disturbance regime in northern pine-oak forests is characterized by both infrequent catastrophic fire and frequent stand-perpetuating surface fires. This system fits into Fire Regime Group I, with fires occurring every 10-30yrs and low- to moderate-intensity (surface) fires most common. Severe wind events affect mature stands as infrequently as >1000yrs (MNDNR 2003). Replacement fires occurred more frequently in barrens, young stands of mixed conifers, and mature closed conifers, whereas stands of mature, open conifers were primarily affected by surface fires.

Young white and red pines are killed by surface fires, becoming more resistant to fire disturbance when mature (age 50-100yrs). Once mature (~50yrs), both red pine and white pine are fire-adapted species and can withstand surface fire quite well. Mature stands are less susceptible to stand-replacing fires, due to tall crowns and the wide spacing of dominant trees, which is maintained by surface fires. However, when catastrophic crown fires do occur, mortality is high in all structural layers, and survivorship depends on random variations in fire patterns resulting in unburned areas.

Fifty to 100yrs is required for red and white pine to produce adequate amounts of viable seed for self-replacement; thus crown-fire rotations of <50-100yrs favor early successional species capable of sprouting or invasion (e.g., aspen and birch), as well as species capable of producing seed in short periods (e.g., jack pine and black spruce). White pine is a mid-tolerant species capable of regenerating under full light to shaded conditions. Red pine is less tolerant than white pine, and seedlings can only survive in ~35% or more full sunlight. This red pine-white pine community was predominantly even-aged due to frequent stand-replacing fires, with a relatively uniform structure in terms of tree height and diameter. During fire-free periods or periods with long surface fire rotation, mid-tolerant white pine gained dominance through gap-phase regeneration. During periods of repeated surface fires, red pine was favored over white pine. 

Successional dynamics within this community were driven by interactions of disturbance regimes and neighborhood effects of nearby seed sources. Areas burning twice within short periods became temporary open lands and barrens or early-successional aspen-birch.                  

Heinselman (1981) suggested there are two types of red-white pine systems -- those maintained by frequent surface fires and a crown-fire rotation <150yrs and those maintained by infrequent surface fires and crown-fire rotations between 150-300yrs. In the former, even-aged stands dominated, whereas in the latter systems, multi-aged white pine systems eventually developed. This description applies to red-white pine that occurred within landscape ecosystems where stand-replacing fires burned with 150yr rotations. Surface and crown fire regimes interacted to regulate age, landscape, within-stand structure, and succession within this community. Fire probability often increased with stand age due to the general increase in fuel (Clark 1990; Heinselman 1973), but individual tree susceptibility to damage or mortality from fire often declined with tree size due to increasing bark thickness and a separation of foliage from the ground, which reduces crown-fire occurrence. Red-white pine forests were disturbed by large-scale, stand-replacing, crown fires in northern Lower Michigan within rotations of 130-260yrs (Whitney 1986) and relatively frequent surface fires. In Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, Zhang et al. (1999) estimated that mixed red-jack-white pine communities burned on 160yr rotations and that red-white pine communities burned on 320yr rotations. Clark (1990), Heinselman (1981), and Frissel (1973) reported rotations of 135, 180, and 150yrs, respectively, for red-white pine communities in Minnesota. Cleland et al. (2004a) estimated crown-fire rotations for the red-white pine community to be 164, 174, and 207yrs in northern Lower Michigan, Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and northern Wisconsin, respectively. Longer rotations in Wisconsin are believed to be due to a higher density of lakes and wetlands, resulting in a smaller surface area of upland landforms.

This community may have promoted surface fires by forming a deep, well-aerated litter layer of pine needles (McCune 1988). Relatively frequent surface fires (10-30yr cycles) reduced fuel loadings, eliminated living fuel ladders, and promoted widely spaced trees that became increasingly resistant to crown fires over time (Frissell 1973). Surface fire regimes favored species with survival adaptations including thick bark and tall crowns and maintained a landscape with a large proportion composed of widely spaced, large pine. Surface fires also reduced competition and limited succession of more shade-tolerant species. Area maintained by surface fire was likely inversely related to area burned by crown fire, due to reduced fuel loadings and removal of shade-tolerant, coniferous fuel ladders. Fires burning in closed forests could be quite variable in intensity -- from light surface fires to intense crown fires. Thus, each fire event represented a complex of fire types, with forest maintenance surface fires and forest-replacement crown fires interacting to form a single overall regime. Increased frequency of maintenance fires lengthened crown-fire rotations by reducing fuel loadings and eliminating the fuel ladders that promote crown fires.

Notes from 2017 BpS review:
Drobyshev et al. (2009) reported wide variation in fire rotation intervals for Seney National Wildlife Refuge, 30-144yrs historically, with most fires being non-replacement.  Some areas had fire much more frequently. Fire frequency related to landform (also see White and Host 2008, report landform-fire relationship in Minnesota).
Seedling establishment of red and white pines positively correlated with number of fires.  See Nyamai et al. (2014) for more information.  
Magruder et al. (2013) report that thinning increases climatic resilience of red pine.","Landscape must be adequate in size to contain natural variation in vegetation and disturbance regime. Though the virgin stands of red and white pine are greatly reduced from pre-settlement conditions, scattered stands and ecosystems still exist to represent this type. The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) is an example, along with the national forests in Minnesota (Chippewa, Superior), Michigan (Ottawa, Hiawatha), and Wisconsin (Chequamegon, Nicolet) and the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin.","The natural range of red pine and white pine largely coincides with the extent of the Canadian shield. These pine forests were widespread in the past and included a diverse mixture of hardwood and conifer species including trembling aspen, bigtooth aspen, paper birch, white spruce, black spruce, balsam fir, red maple, sugar maple, and northern red oak. BpS 1301 -- Boreal Aspen Birch Forest has been eliminated and lumped into several other BpSs in the Great Lakes. Trembling aspen-paper birch may have been a significant component of the early successional stages of this and other BpSs. 

Sites supporting dominance of Tsuga canadensis (>25%), with varying mixtures of Pinus strobus, Thuja occidentalis, and other northern hardwood species, such as Betula alleghaniensis, Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Quercus rubra, and the absence of any of the Appalachian species, including Aesculus flava, Betula lenta, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus prinus. Picea glauca, Picea rubens, and Abies balsamea <25%, are placed in Eastern Hemlock -- Eastern White Pine -- Yellow Birch Forest Group (Gawler and Faber-Langendoen 2015). Hemlock and white pine can be co-dominant at the margins of dune ridges that are otherwise characterized by more xeric red pine-white pine communities in Upper Michigan.

Historically, this system was one of the most economically important species group in the lake states region. Extensive logging and subsequent slash fires that occurred throughout the Great Lakes in the mid- to late 1800s reduced the extent of this system.

Frelich has documented wind disturbance of catastrophic proportions as occurring on a 1,000-2,000yr interval. Granted that this may possibly be the landscape-level mean, wind events are far more prevalent and occur randomly and with widespread regularity throughout the range of the red and white pine cover type. Thus, using local data, the wind event probability was increased to occur on an ~250yr average.",NA,"Laurentian-Acadian Pine -- Oak Forest and Woodland Group per NVC (Menard and Gawler 2010; = Eastern White Pine -- Jack Pine -- Northern Red Oak Forest and Woodland Group).

Fire Regime Group III (13621 is Fire Regime Group I).","The red pine (Pinus resinosa), white pine (Pinus strobus) cover type is found throughout the Great Lakes region, including northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. This red-white pine community described here is for map zone (MZ) 41 and historically occurred mainly in subsection 212La but also in 212Lb, c, d, and e. For MZ50, 212xb, also smaller patches across northern Wisconsin.","The area is on part of the Laurentian Peneplain and is geologically complex. It is underlain with Precambrian rock mainly granite, greenstones, and slates. Soils where the type occurs are composed of sandy to sandy gravelly loams and till (Heinselman 1996; Ohmann and Ream 1971). Frequently occurs on end moraines.","Red pine often shares dominance with white pine in the overstory, red pine being more dominant on the drier sites. Balsam fir, white and black spruce, and white cedar may also be present. The tall shrub layer is not normally abundant with beaked hazel, green alder, and juneberry being the most common. The ground vegetation is often sparse, dominated by blueberry, sweet fern (Comptonia peregrina), large-leafed aster, and wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis). Less abundant are bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), wintergreen, and pipsissewa. 

Stands are multi-aged, with at least two cohorts. Historically, there was often a super-canopy pine cohort followed by a younger, more abundant pine cohort. Due to variation in fire severity, there are small- to medium-scale inclusions of different cohorts within large stands (Heinselman 1996; Van Wagner 1971).","The fire regime is characterized by semi-frequent surface fires and infrequent crown fires with red pine stands burning more frequently than white pine. The average frequency for red pine is in the range of 10-40yrs (Heinselman 1973; Frissell 1973). The lower bound frequency for white pine is slightly longer with a range of 20-40yrs. These periodic surface fires can perpetuate the stand indefinitely, barring other disturbances such as logging or windthrow. Stand-replacement fires occur every 150-200yrs and 200-250yrs for red and white pine, respectively.","Landscape must be adequate in size to contain natural variation in vegetation and disturbance regime. Though the virgin stands of red and white pine are greatly reduced from pre-settlement conditions, scattered stands and ecosystems still exist to represent this type. The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) is an example, along with the national forests in Minnesota (Chippewa, Superior), Michigan (Ottawa, Hiawatha), and Wisconsin (Chequamegon-Nicolet) and Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin.","Due to the complexity of the landform, adjacent types can include any type common to the region. However, most common adjacent types include jack pine, aspen, birch, and fir (mixedwood).

As seen today, the shrub/hardwood understory of this type is much denser than was common historically due to fire suppression.

Some sites were converted to aspen birch after logging. This occurred on the more mesic sites where the initial condition had a high component of aspen and birch.

Much of this type was heavily altered during landscape-scale historical harvesting in the late 1800s and early 1900s (Mladenoff and Pastor 1993).","The VDDT model was modified to increase the probability of wind storm events. Frelich has documented wind disturbance of catastrophic proportions as occurring on a 1,000-2,000yr interval.

This type occurs in southern lower Michigan, northwestern Ohio, northern Indiana, northeastern Illinois, southern Wisconsin and southeastern to northwestern Minnesota. The system is found in ECOMAP (Cleland et al. 2007) subsections: 222J: b, h, g and sand deposits in the Huron/Erie Lake Plains Ecoregion, corresponding to the Oak Openings region west of Toledo in northwest Ohio, and on well-drained slopes and coarse-textured substrates in the Southern Michigan/Northern Indiana Drift Plains Ecoregion in northern Indiana (Woods et al. 1998).","North-Central Oak Barrens occur on well-drained, nearly level to slightly undulating sandy glacial outwash, and less often on sandy moraines or ice contact features. Oak barrens typically occur in the driest landscape positions, such as ridge tops, steep slopes, south and west facing slopes, and flat sand plains. This xeric, fire-prone community is characterized by soils that are infertile, coarse-textured, well-drained sand or loamy sand with moderately to slightly acid pH and low water retaining capacity. Soils contain low organic matter and lack the fine-textured alluvial horizon associated with soils of the oak openings (oak savannas) and are thus droughty. Oak barrens typically occur in bands surrounding prairie (Chapman et al. 1995, Michigan Natural Features Inventory 2003). In general, oak barrens are most prevalent on the western side of major firebreaks such as rivers (Leitner et al. 1991, Grimm 1984, Curtis 1959). In the 1800s, the oak savanna communities (e.g., oak barrens, oak openings, oak savannas) covered some 11-13m ha (27-32m ac) of the Midwest (Nuzzo 1986).","The oak barrens community is a heterogeneous savanna vegetation type with variable physiognomy in time and space. Structurally, oak barrens range from dense thickets of brush and understory scrub oak within a matrix of grassland to park-like open woods of widely spaced mature oak with virtually no shrub or sub-canopy layer above the open forb and graminoid understory (Chapman et al. 1995, Bowles and McBride 1998, Michigan Natural Features Inventory 2003). The physiognomic variations, which occur along a continuum, are the function of the complex interplay between fire frequency and intensity (Chapman et al. 1995). Typically, oak barrens grade into prairie on one edge and dry forest on the other. As noted by Bray (1958) and Curtis (1959), the flora of this community is a mixture of prairie and forest species, with prairie forbs and grasses more abundant in high light areas and forest forbs and woody species in the areas of low light. 

The canopy layer generally varies from 5-60% cover (Chapman et al. 1995) and is dominated or co-dominated by Quercus velutina (black oak) and Quercus alba (white oak). These species of oak are also prevalent in the sub-canopy in shrubby clumps, especially where fire intensity is high. In addition, Acer rubra (red maple), Prunus serotina (black cherry), Populus grandidentata (bigtooth aspen), Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) and Quercus ellipsoidalis (northern pin oak) are often found in the overstory and sub-canopy of this community. Northern pin oak is especially common on excessively well-drained sites. Prevalent species of the subcanopy layer include Cornus spp. (dogwood species), Corylus americana (American hazelnut) and Prunus spp. (cherry species), and in Michigan, Sassafras albidum (sassafras). 

Characteristic shrubs include: Amelanchier spp. (serviceberry), Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry), Ceanothus americanus (New Jersey tea), Comptonia peregrina (sweetfern), Corylus americana, Cornus spp., Corylus cornuta (beaked hazelnut), Cratageus spp. (hawthorn species), Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen), Gaylussacia baccata (huckleberry), Prunus americana (wild plum), Prunus virginiana (choke cherry), Prunus pumila (sand cherry), Rosa carolina (pasture rose), Rubus flagellaris (northern dewberry), Salix humilis (prairie or upland willow) and Vaccinium angustifolium (low sweet blueberry) and in Michigan, Rhus copalina (shining sumac), Ptelea trifoliate (hop tree) and Quercus prinoides (dwarf chestnut or dwarf chinkapin oak).

The ground layer is dominated by graminoids and forbs. Common species include Scizhachyrium scoparium (little bluestem), Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) and Carex pensylvanica (Pennsylvania sedge), with Pennsylvania sedge often replacing the bluestems in shaded areas and fire-suppressed communities. Other prevalent herbs of the oak barrens include: Aster oolentangiensis (sky-blue aster), Aureolaria spp. (false foxglove), Coreopsis lanceolata (tickseed), Cyperus filiculmis (nut grass), Danthonia spicata (poverty oats), Deschampsia flexuosa (hair grass), Euphorbia corollata (flowering spurge), Helianthus divaricatus (tall sunflower), Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s-wort), Koeleria macrantha (June grass), Krigia biflora (dwarf dandelion), Lathyrus ochroleucus (white pea), Lespedeza hirta (hairy lespedeza), Liatris aspera (blazing star), Liatris cylindrica (dwarf blazing star), Lupinus perennis (wild lupine), Monarda fistulosa (wild bergamot), Panicum implicatum (grass panicum), Pedicularis canadensis (wood betony), Stipa avenacea (needle grass), Stipa spartea (needle grass), Tephrosia virginiana (goats-rue) and Viola pedata (birdfoot violet).","Cottam (1949) and Curtis (1959) suggested that oak savannas originated when prairie fires spread into surrounding closed oak forest with enough intensity to create open canopy conditions (also see Anderson and Brown 1986, Anderson and Bowles 1999). Other researchers have proposed that savannas also originated following invasion of prairie by oaks during prolonged lulls in annual fire regimes (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Grimm 1984). Repeated low-intensity fires working in concert with drought and windthrow then maintained these savannas (Faber-Langendoen and Tester 1993, Curtis 1959, Stout 1946). Within dry-mesic savanna systems, such as oak openings, it is likely that annual or nearly annual fire disturbance was the primary abiotic factor influencing savanna structure and composition. Fires prevented canopy closure and the dominance of woody vegetation (Leitner et al. 1991). Presently, the prevalent catalyst of fires is lightning strike, but historically, Native Americans played an integral role in the fire regime, accidentally and/or intentionally setting fire to prairie and savanna ecosystems (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Bowles and McBride 1998, Dorney and Dorney 1989, Chapman 1984, Grimm 1984, Day 1953). Where large-scale herbivores (i.e., elk and bison) were abundant, grazing may have helped inhibit the succession of oak savanna to woodland (Ritchie et al. 1998, McClain et al. 1993). 

The character of oak barrens can differ dramatically, primarily as the result of varying fire intensity and frequency, which are influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture, topography, size of physiographic and vegetative units, and landscape context (i.e., proximity to water bodies and fire-resistant and fire-conducive plant communities) (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Chapman et al. 1995, Bowles et al. 1994, Grimm 1984). Historically, fire regimes were also influenced by the number and distribution of indigenous peoples (Chapman 1984). Infrequent, high-intensity fires may kill mature oaks and produce savannas and barrens covered by abundant scrubby oak sprouts. Park-like openings with widely spaced trees and an open graminoid/forb understory are maintained by frequent, low-intensity fires, which occur often enough to restrict maturation of oak seedlings and encroachment by other woody species (Peterson and Reich 2001, Chapman et al. 1995, Faber-Langendoen and Davis 1995).

Oak wilt occurred on barrens likely resulting in mortality of larger oak groups especially when they occurred in high densities.","The expected fire regimes for this type are I (frequent ground fires) and III (mixed severity). The ground fire was the more commonly occurring fire disturbance, but when dry conditions combined with dense stand conditions, a mixed-severity fire could result, with the fire crowning into the canopy where fuel ladders were present. The scale of these fires is thought to occur on tens of thousands of acres.","The northern oak savanna type includes several matrix communities such as mesic and dry-mesic oak openings, dry oak barrens, mixed oak and oak-hickory woodlands, and a variety of small and large patch prairie types. 

This system intergrades with North-Central Interior Oak Savanna (Biophysical Setting [BpS] 13940) on somewhat sandy sites and North-Central Interior Dry Oak Forest and Woodland (BpS 13110) at relatively sharp transitions between areas of higher and lower sand content. This system can be distinguished by high sand content. This system intergrades with Laurentian Pine-Oak Barrens (BpS 1407) along its northern extent. This system is found in Province 222 whereas Laurentian Pine-Oak Barrens is found north of the tension zone in Province 212.

In the absence of fire and with the prevalence of anthropogenic disturbance such as logging, off-road vehicle recreation, and livestock grazing, the following exotic species may be dominant components of the herbaceous layer of oak barrens: Agropyron repens (quack grass), Agrostis stolonifera (creeping bent), Asparagus officinalis (wild asparagus), Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), Hieracium spp. (hawkweeds), Poa compressa (Canada bluegrass), Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), Rumex acetosella (sheep sorrel) and Tragopogon dubius (goat’s beard).","Changed mixed fire probability in classes C and D to send more to B based on LANDSUM results (MH Weber - MFSL 11/13/07). This type covers a broad geographic range and encompasses a variety of prairie, barrens and woodland types that may have experienced different surface fire return intervals ranging from one to five years. Historical fire size is unknown but historical accounts indicate that vast acreages burned within a single fire event.

This type occurs in southern lower Michigan, northwestern Ohio, northern Indiana, northeastern Illinois, southern Wisconsin and southeastern to northwestern Minnesota. The system is found in sections (Cleland et al. 2007): 222J: b, h, g and c.","North-Central Oak Barrens occur on well-drained, nearly level to slightly undulating sandy glacial outwash, and less often on sandy moraines or ice contact features. Oak barrens typically occur in the driest landscape positions, such as ridge tops, steep slopes, south and west facing slopes and flat sand plains.

In general, oak barrens are most prevalent on the western side of major firebreaks such as rivers (Leitner et al. 1991, Grimm 1984, Curtis 1959). In the 1800s, the oak savanna communities (e.g., oak barrens, oak openings, oak savannas) covered some 11 to 13 million ha (27 to 32 million ac) of the Midwest (Nuzzo 1986).","The oak barrens community is a heterogeneous savanna vegetation type with variable physiognomy in time and space. Structurally, oak barrens range from dense thickets of brush and understory scrub oak within a matrix of grassland to park-like open woods of widely spaced mature oak with virtually no shrub or sub-canopy layer above the open forb and graminoid understory (Chapman et al. 1995, Bowles and McBride 1998, Michigan Natural Features Inventory 2003. The physiognomic variations, which occur along a continuum, are the function of the complex interplay between fire frequency and intensity (Chapman et al. 1995). Typically, oak barrens grade into prairie on one edge and dry forest on the other. As noted by Bray (1958) and Curtis (1959), the flora of this community is a mixture of prairie and forest species, with prairie forbs and grasses more abundant in high light areas and forest forbs and woody species in the areas of low light. 

The canopy layer generally varies from 5-60% cover (Chapman et al. 1995) and is dominated or co-dominated by Quercus velutina (black oak) and Quercus alba (white oak). These species of oak are also prevalent in the sub-canopy in shrubby clumps, especially where fire intensity is high. In addition, Acer rubra (red maple), Prunus serotina (black cherry), Populus grandidentata (bigtooth aspen), Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) and Quercus ellipsoidalis (northern pin oak) are often found in the overstory and sub-canopy of this community. Northern pin oak is especially common on excessively well-drained sites. Prevalent species of the subcanopy layer include Cornus spp. (dogwood species), Corylus americana (American hazelnut), Prunus spp. (cherry species), and in Michigan, Sassafras albidum (sassafras). 

Characteristic shrubs include: Amelanchier spp. (serviceberry), Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry), Ceanothus americanus (New Jersey tea), Comptonia peregrina (sweetfern), Corylus americana, Cornus spp., Corylus cornuta (beaked hazelnut), Cratageus spp. (hawthorn species), Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen), Gaylussacia baccata (huckleberry), Prunus americana (wild plum), Prunus virginiana (choke cherry), Prunus pumila (sand cherry), Rosa carolina (pasture rose), Rubus flagellaris (northern dewberry), Salix humilis (prairie or upland willow), and Vaccinium angustifolium (low sweet blueberry) and in Michigan, Rhus copalina (shining sumac), and Ptelea trifoliate (hop tree) and Quercus prinoides (dwarf chestnut or dwarf chinkapin oak).

The ground layer is dominated by graminoids and forbs. Common species include Scizhachyrium scoparium (little bluestem), Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem), and Carex pensylvanica (Pennsylvania sedge), with Pennsylvania sedge often replacing the bluestems in shaded areas and fire-suppressed communities. Other prevalent herbs of the oak barrens include: Aster oolentangiensis (sky-blue aster), Aureolaria spp. (false foxglove), Coreopsis lanceolata (tickseed), Cyperus filiculmis (nut grass), Danthonia spicata (poverty oats), Deschampsia flexuosa (hair grass), Euphorbia corollata (flowering spurge), Helianthus divaricatus (tall sunflower), Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s-wort), Koeleria macrantha (June grass), Krigia biflora (dwarf dandelion), Lathyrus ochroleucus (white pea), Lespedeza hirta (hairy lespedeza), Liatris aspera (blazing star), Liatris cylindrica (dwarf blazing star), Lupinus perennis (wild lupine), Monarda fistulosa (wild bergamot), Panicum implicatum (grass panicum), Pedicularis canadensis (wood betony), Stipa avenacea (needle grass), Stipa spartea (needle grass), Tephrosia virginiana (goats-rue) and Viola pedata (birdfoot violet).","Cottam (1949) and Curtis (1959) suggested that oak savannas originated when prairie fires spread into surrounding closed oak forest with enough intensity to create open canopy conditions (also see Anderson and Brown 1986, Anderson and Bowles 1999). Other researchers have proposed that savannas also originated following invasion of prairie by oaks during prolonged lulls in annual fire regimes (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Grimm 1984). Repeated low-intensity fires working in concert with drought and windthrow then maintained these savannas (Faber-Langendoen and Tester 1993, Curtis 1959, Stout 1946). Within dry-mesic savanna systems, such as oak openings, it is likely that annual or nearly annual fire disturbance was the primary abiotic factor influencing savanna structure and composition. Fires prevented canopy closure and the dominance of woody vegetation (Leitner et al. 1991). Presently, the prevalent catalyst of fires is lightning strike, but historically, Native Americans played an integral role in the fire regime, accidentally and/or intentionally setting fire to prairie and savanna ecosystems (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Bowles and McBride 1998, Dorney and Dorney 1989, Chapman 1984, Grimm 1984, Day 1953). Where large-scale herbivores (i.e., elk and bison) were abundant, grazing may have helped inhibit the succession of oak savanna to woodland (Ritchie et al. 1998, McClain et al. 1993). 

The character of oak barrens can differ dramatically, primarily as the result of varying fire intensity and frequency, which are influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture, topography, size of physiographic and vegetative units, and landscape context (i.e., proximity to water bodies and fire-resistant and fire-conducive plant communities) (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Chapman et al. 1995, Bowles et al. 1994, Grimm 1984). Historically, fire regimes were also influenced by the number and distribution of indigenous peoples (Chapman 1984). Infrequent, high-intensity fires may kill mature oaks and produce savannas and barrens covered by abundant scrubby oak sprouts. Park-like openings with widely spaced trees and an open graminoid/forb understory are maintained by frequent, low-intensity fires, which occur often enough to restrict maturation of oak seedlings and encroachment by other woody species (Peterson and Reich 2001, Chapman et al. 1995, Faber-Langendoen and Davis 1995).

Oak wilt occurred on barrens likely resulting in mortality of larger oak groups especially when they occurred in high densities.","The expected fire regimes for this type are I (frequent ground fires) and III (mixed severity). The ground fire was the more commonly occurring fire disturbance, but when dry conditions combined with dense stand conditions, a mixed-severity fire could result, with the fire crowning into the canopy where fuel ladders were present. The scale of these fires is thought to occur on 10s of 1,000s of acres.","The northern oak savanna type includes several matrix communities such as mesic and dry-mesic oak openings, dry oak barrens, mixed oak and oak-hickory woodlands, and a variety of small and large patch prairie types.

51",NA,NA,"Northern-central oak barrens occur in a complex, shifting mosaic with open prairie, oak savanna and dry oak woodlands in the upper Midwest. This type occurs in southern lower Michigan, northwestern Ohio, northern Indiana, northeastern Illinois, southern Wisconsin and southeastern to northwestern Minnesota. The system is found in Sections (Cleland et al. 2007): 222J: b, h, g and c.","North-central oak barrens occur on well-drained, nearly level to slightly undulating sandy glacial outwash, and less often on sandy moraines or ice contact features. Oak barrens typically occur in the driest landscape positions, such as ridge tops, steep slopes, south and west facing slopes and flat sand plains. This xeric, fire-prone community is characterized by soils that are infertile, coarse-textured, well-drained sand or loamy sand with medium to slightly acid pH and low water retaining capacity. Soils contain low organic matter and lack the fine-textured alluvial horizon associated with soils of the oak openings (oak savannas) and are thus more droughty. Oak barrens typically occur in bands surrounding prairie (Chapman et al. 1995, Michigan Natural Features Inventory 2003). In general, oak barrens are most prevalent on the western side of major firebreaks such as rivers (Leitner et al. 1991, Grimm 1984, Curtis 1959). In the 1800s, the oak savanna communities (e.g., oak barrens, oak openings, oak savannas) covered some 11-13 million ha (27-32 million ac) of the Midwest (Nuzzo 1986).","The oak barrens community is a heterogeneous savanna vegetation type with variable physiognomy in time and space. Structurally, oak barrens range from dense thickets of brush and understory oak grubs within a matrix of grassland to park-like open woods of widely spaced mature oak with virtually no shrub or sub-canopy layer above the open forb and graminoid understory (Chapman et al. 1995, Bowles and McBride 1998, Michigan Natural Features Inventory 2003. The physiognomic variations, which occur along a continuum, are the function of the complex interplay between fire frequency and intensity (Chapman et al. 1995). Typically, oak barrens grade into prairie on one edge and dry forest on the other. As noted by Bray (1958) and Curtis (1959), the flora of this community is a mixture of prairie and forest species, with prairie forbs and grasses more abundant in high light areas and forest forbs and woody species in the areas of low light. 

The canopy layer generally varies from 5-60% cover (Chapman et al. 1995) and is dominated or co-dominated by Quercus velutina (black oak) and Quercus alba (white oak). These species of oak are also prevalent in the sub-canopy in shrubby clumps, especially where fire intensity is high. In addition, Acer rubrum (red maple), Prunus serotina (black cherry), Populus grandidentata (bigtooth aspen), Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) and Quercus ellipsoidalis (northern pin oak) are often found in the overstory and sub-canopy of this community. Northern pin oak is especially common on excessively intermediate sites. Prevalent species of the subcanopy layer include Cornus spp. (dogwood species), Corylus americana (American hazelnut), Prunus spp. (cherry species) and Sassafras albidum (sassafras). 

Characteristic shrubs include: Amelanchier spp. (serviceberry), Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry), Ceanothus americanus (New Jersey tea), Comptonia peregrina (sweetfern), Corylus americana, Cornus spp., Corylus cornuta (beaked hazelnut), Cratageus spp. (hawthorn species), Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen), Gaylussacia baccata (huckleberry), Prunus americana (wild plum), Prunus virginiana (choke cherry), Prunus pumila (sand cherry), Rosa carolina (pasture rose), Rubus flagellaris (northern dewberry), Salix humilis (prairie or upland willow) and Vaccinium angustifolium (low sweet blueberry) and in Michigan, Rhus copalina (shining sumac) and Ptelea trifoliate (hop tree), and Quercus prinoides (dwarf chestnut or dwarf chinkapin oak).

The ground layer is dominated by graminoids and forbs. Common species include Scizhachyrium scoparium (little bluestem), Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) and Carex pensylvanica (Pennsylvania sedge), with Pennsylvania sedge often replacing the bluestems in shaded areas and fire-suppressed communities. Other prevalent herbs of the oak barrens include: Aster oolentangiensis (sky-blue aster), Aureolaria spp. (false foxglove), Coreopsis lanceolata (tickseed), Cyperus filiculmis (nut grass), Danthonia spicata (poverty oats), Deschampsia flexuosa (hair grass), Euphorbia corollata (flowering spurge), Helianthus divaricatus (tall sunflower), Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s-wort), Koeleria macrantha (June grass), Krigia biflora (dwarf dandelion), Lathyrus ochroleucus (white pea), Lespedeza hirta (hairy lespedeza), Liatris aspera (blazing star), Liatris cylindrica (dwarf blazing star), Lupinus perennis (wild lupine), Monarda fistulosa (wild bergamot), Panicum implicatum (grass panicum), Pedicularis canadensis (wood betony), Stipa avenacea (needle grass), Stipa spartea (needle grass), Tephrosia virginiana (goats-rue) and Viola pedata (birdfoot violet).","Cottam (1949) and Curtis (1959) suggested that oak savannas originated when prairie fires spread into surrounding closed oak forest with enough intensity to create open canopy conditions (also see Anderson and Brown 1986, Anderson and Bowles 1999). Other researchers have proposed that savannas also originated following invasion of prairie by oaks during prolonged lulls in annual fire regimes (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Grimm 1984). Repeated low-intensity fires working in concert with drought and windthrow then maintained these savannas (Faber-Langendoen and Tester 1993, Curtis 1959, Stout 1946). Within dry-mesic savanna systems, such as oak openings, it is likely that annual or nearly annual fire disturbance was the primary abiotic factor influencing savanna structure and composition. Fires prevented canopy closure and the dominance of woody vegetation (Leitner et al. 1991). Presently, the prevalent catalyst of fires is lightning strike, but historically, Native Americans played an integral role in the fire regime, accidentally and/or intentionally setting fire to prairie and savanna ecosystems (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Bowles and McBride 1998, Dorney and Dorney 1989, Chapman 1984, Grimm 1984, Day 1953). Where large-scale herbivores (i.e., elk and bison) were abundant, grazing may have helped inhibit the succession of oak savanna to woodland (Ritchie et al. 1998, McClain et al. 1993). 

The character of oak barrens can differ dramatically, primarily as the result of varying fire intensity and frequency, which are influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture, topography, size of physiographic and vegetative units, and landscape context (i.e., proximity to water bodies and fire-resistant and fire-conducive plant communities) (Anderson and Bowles 1999, Chapman et al. 1995, Bowles et al. 1994, Grimm 1984). Historically, fire regimes were also influenced by the number and distribution of indigenous peoples (Chapman 1984). Infrequent, high-intensity fires may kill mature oaks and produce savannas and barrens covered by abundant scrubby oak sprouts. Park-like openings with widely spaced trees and an open graminoid/forb understory are maintained by frequent, low-intensity fires, which occur often enough to restrict maturation of oak seedlings and encroachment by other woody species (Peterson and Reich 2001, Chapman et al. 1995, Faber-Langendoen and Davis 1995).

Oak wilt occurred on barrens likely resulting in mortality of larger oak groups especially when they occurred in high densities.","The expected fire regimes for this type are I (frequent ground fires) and III (mixed severity). The ground fire was the more commonly occurring fire disturbance, but when dry conditions combined with dense stand conditions, a mixed-severity fire could result, with the fire crowning into the canopy where fuel ladders were present. The scale of these fires is thought to occur on 10s of 1,000s of acres.","The northern oak savanna type includes several matrix communities such as mesic and dry-mesic oak openings, dry oak barrens, mixed oak and oak-hickory woodlands, and a variety of small and large patch prairie types. This type includes the following ecological systems: North-Central Interior Oak Savanna (CES202.698) and North-Central Oak Barrens (CES202.727).

In the absence of fire and with the prevalence of anthropogenic disturbance such as logging, off-road vehicle recreation, and livestock grazing, the following exotic species may be dominant components of the herbaceous layer of oak barrens: Agropyron repens (quack grass), Agrostis stolonifera (creeping bent), Asparagus officinalis (wild asparagus), Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), Hieracium spp. (hawkweeds), Poa compressa (Canada bluegrass), Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), Rumex acetosella (sheep sorrel) and Tragopogon dubius (goat’s beard).","Mixed fire probability changed from 500yrs to 40yrs in class C by reviewer from Missoula Fire Science Laboratory to fix Reference Condition proportions in LANDSUM (12.170.07). This type covers a broad geographic range and encompasses a variety of prairie, barrens and woodland types that may have experienced different surface fire return intervals ranging from 1-5yrs. Historical fire size is unknown but historical accounts indicate that vast acreages burned within a single fire event.",NA,NA,"Abrams, M.D. 1992. Fire and the development of oak forests.

"9","14071_41_50_51.docx","Steppe/Savanna","41, 50, 51","This Biophysical Setting (BpS) was split into two - 1407-1 (Laurentian Pine-Oak Barrens) and 1407-2 (Jack-Pine Barrens)","Laurentian Pine-oak Barrens were located on sandy outwash plains located along the climatic tension zone in Michigan and Wisconsin. In Michigan the system occurs along the Sandusky lakeplain, the Newaygo Outwash Plain, and in several counties of the Upper Peninsula, including Menominee, Dickinson, Delta and Chippewa counties (Comer et al. 1995). In Michigan, presently the distribution of this community is concentrated in the Newaygo Outwash Plain with additional remnants in the sandy outwash plains of Menominee and Dickinson counties and the sandy lakeplain of Huron County (Cohen 2000). In Michigan the system occurred in subsections 212 Ha, Hb, Hg, Ka; 222 Ja, Jb; 212 Tb, Td and 212 Rc. 

Laurentain pine-oak barrens also occurred in Wisconsin between the southern oak barrens/ savanna and northern jack pine barrens (Cochrane and Iltis 2000, Curtis 1959). In Wisconsin, this system occurred in Subsections 212 Ta, 222 Kb, 222 Ra and Rb, 212 Qa, Qb, Qc and Qd.","The Laurentian pine-oak barrens system is endemic to very dry, nutrient-impoverished landscape ecosystems. Pine-oak barrens occur on nearly level to slightly undulating ground in well-drained sandy glacial outwash, sandy glacial lakeplains, and less often on sandy areas in coarse-textured moraines. Soils of this xeric, fire-prone community are generally coarse-textured, well-drained sand or loamy sand of medium to slightly acid pH and low water retaining capacity. Soils typically lack the fine-textured alluvial horizon associated with soils of the oak openings and are thus more droughty. Oak-pine and oak barrens typically occur in bands surrounding prairie (Michigan Natural Features Inventory 1990). They are generally found in transitional areas along the tension zone (Cohen 2000).","The oak-pine barrens community is a heterogeneous savanna vegetation type. Structurally oak-pine barrens range from dense thickets of brush and understory scrub oak and pine amongst a matrix of grassland to park-like open woods of widely spaced mature oak and pines with virtually no shrub or sub-canopy layer above the open forb and graminoid understory (Chapman et al. 1995, Lohrentz and Mattei 1995, Michigan Natural Features Inventory 1990). The physiognomic variations, which occur along a continuum, are the function of the frequency and intensity of fire (Lohrentz and Mattei 1995). Typically, oak-pine barrens grade into prairie on one front and dry forest on the other. As noted by Curtis (1959), the flora of this community is a mixture of prairie and forest species. 

The canopy layer generally varies from 5-60% cover (Chapman et al. 1989) and is dominated or co-dominated by the following trees: Quercus alba (white oak), Quercus velutina (black oak), Quercus ellipsoidalis (northern pin oak), Pinus strobus (white pine), Pinus resinosa (red pine) and Pinus banksiana (jack pine). The above species of pine and oak are also prevalent in the sub-canopy in shrubby clumps, especially where fire intensity is high. In addition, Acer rubra (red maple), Prunus serotina (black cherry), Populus grandidentata (bigtooth aspen), and Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) are often found in the overstory and sub-canopy of this community. Along the transition zone and to the south, the most common overstory dominants are white oak, black oak and white pine. North of the transition zone, northern pin oak replaces black oak and red pine and jack pine become more prevalent in the canopy layer. (Michigan Natural Features Inventory 1990).

Characteristic shrubs include: Amelanchier spp. (serviceberry), Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry or kinnikinick), Ceanothus americanus (New Jersey tea), Comptonia peregrina (sweetfern), Corylus americana (American hazelnut), Cornus spp (dogwood species), Corylus cornuta (beaked hazelnut), Cratageus spp (hawthorn species), Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen), Gaylussacia baccata (huckleberry), Prunus americana (wild plum), Prunus virginiana (choke cherry), Prunus pumila (sand cherry), Quercus prinoides (dwarf chestnut or dwarf chinkapin oak), Rosa carolina (pasture rose), Rubus flagellaris (northern dewberry), Salix humilis (prairie or upland willow) and Vaccinium angustifolium (low sweet blueberry).

The ground layer is dominated by graminoids and forbs. Common species include Scizhachyrium scoparium (little bluestem), Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) and Carex pensylvanica (Pennsylvania sedge), with Pennsylvania sedge often replacing the bluestems in shaded areas, fire suppressed communities, and north of the transition zone. Other prevalent herbs of the oak-pine barrens include: Aster oolentangiensis (sky-blue aster), Aureolaria spp. (false foxglove), Coreopsis lanceolata (tickseed), Danthonia spicata (poverty oats), Deschampsia flexuosa (hair grass), Euphorbia corollata (flowering spurge), Helianthus divaricatus (Divaricate sunflower), Koeleria macrantha (June grass), Krigia biflora (dwarf dandelion), Lathyrus ochroleucus (white pea), Lespedeza hirta (hairy lespedeza), Liatris cylindrica (dwarf blazing star), Lupinus perennis (wild lupine), Monarda fistulosa (wild bergamot), Pedicularis canadensis (wood betony) and Stipa avenacea (needle grass).","Frequent fire and, in some places, frost and drought conditions, maintain open canopy conditions by limiting the development of woody vegetation and thereby allowing the maintenance of a mixture of grasses and sedges. 

Curtis (1959) suggested that oak barrens originated when prairie fires spread into surrounding closed oak forest with enough intensity to create open barrens. Repeated low intensity fires working in concert with periodic drought then maintain these barrens. Oak-pine barrens persist when fire disturbance prevents canopy closure and the dominance of woody vegetation. Presently, the prevalent catalyst of such fires is lighting strike but historically, Native Americans played an integral role in the fire regime, accidentally and/or intentionally setting fire to prairie ecosystems (Chapman 1984, in Lohrentz and Mattei 1995).

The character of oak-pine barrens can differ dramatically as the result of varying fire intensity and frequency, which is influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture, and topography. Infrequent, high intensity fires kill mature oaks and produce barrens covered by scrubby oak sprouts and scattered pines, which survived the burn. Park-like barrens with widely spaced trees and an open grass understory are maintained by low intensity, frequent fires, which occur often enough to restrict oak seedlings (Chapman et al. 1995, Lohrentz and Mattei 1995). Frequent fires of low intensity can maintain high levels of grass and forb diversity by deterring the encroachment of woody vegetation and limiting the dominance of the mat-forming sedge Carex pensylvanica, (Pennsylvania sedge) (Corner 1996). 

Diseases such as oak wilt also influenced the structure and species composition of pine-oak barrens. Oak wilt would have affected all oak species with white oak being more resistant to wilt than other oak species. Two-lined chestnut borer would affect oak species. Budworms could also pine species in the barrens. These insect breaks would have eliminated groups or clumps of trees. 

Intense weather events such as tornados, down-bursts, or severe windthrow would have been infrequent in this system but severe if and when they did occur.","Historically there was considerable variation in the size and intensity of fires in pine-oak landscapes. As a result pine-oak barrens existed as a small to large patch within a matrix of prairies, barrens and pine-oak forests.","Most of the historical oak-pine barrens have been degraded by selective logging, livestock grazing, and fire suppression or destroyed by extensive timber harvest followed by slash fires and conversion to tree farms or plantations. Plant species of oak-pine barrens can persist through cycles of canopy closure and removal (Chapman et al., 1989). 

Laurentian pine oak barrens may be confused with or mistaken for BpS 1407-2 Jack Pine Barrens, BpS 1395 North-Central Oak Barrens, or 1394 North-Central Interior Oak-Savanna. This system may also be referred to as jack pine barrens, oak barrens, or simply barrens. This system can be distinguished from North-Central Oak Barrens (13950) based on greater dominance of Jack pine, and it becomes the more likely barrens oak type in Province 212.

Currently much of this system may be in a closed state due to fire suppression and may exist as a closed canopy oak or pine forest. Additionally, a large portion of the historic range of this system has been planted to pine plantation.

In the absence of fire and with the prevalence of anthropogenic disturbance such as logging, off-road vehicle recreation, and livestock grazing, the following exotic species may be dominant components of the herbaceous layer of oak-pine barrens: Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), Hieracium spp. (hawkweeds), Poa compressa (Canada bluegrass), Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass) and Rumex acetosella (sheep sorrel).","Need to acquire more detailed information about distribution of pine-oak barrens in Minnesota.

"10","14072_41_50_51.docx","Forest and Woodland","41, 50, 51","This BpS is split into multiple models:
This model is for the jack pine and jack pine-red pine forests of northern MN, WI, and MI.","System occurs in northern lower MI, northern WI (212Ka), northern MN and eastern Ontario, north of the climatic tension zone (Curtis 1959) and is concentrated in the High Plains subsection in northern lower MI and in central WI subsection 212Q (Vora 1993). Also occurs in several locations in the Upper Peninsula of MI, and in northeastern WI (212Te) and is associated with the upper Mississippi and St. Croix Rivers in MN and WI (Comer 1996). There are scattered cases in WI's Northern Forest (212X).","Jack pine and red pine-jack pine (-hardwood) forests are endemic to very dry, nutrient-impoverished landscape ecosystems. These ecosystems occur in landforms deposited by high-energy glacial melt waters, principally outwash plains and glacial lakebeds, underlain by well-sorted, coarse-textured sandy soils with low water retaining capacity. They also occur in bedrock-controlled landforms with shallow soils of limited moisture storage capacity, and on sand ridges within peatland complexes (Cohen et al. 2002; Cleland et al. 2004). They are generally found in cooler climates north of the tension zone. The topography is flat to gently rolling, typically with long expanses capable of carrying wildfires with few natural fire breaks, and often in proximity to even more fire-prone pine barrens.  The soils of this community are sandy, acidic, droughty and relatively infertile (Comer 1996). Where the system occurs on low sand ridges in peatland complexes, the higher water table promotes paludification, which results in accumulation of an organic horizon above the mineral layers. They become established in areas with continental climate, in which summers are typically short and warm to cool, and winters are cold (Pregitzer and Saunders 1999).","Pinus banksiana (jack pine) typically dominates the overstory canopy. Pinus resinosa (red pine) dominates some stands and may form a scattered supercanopy in stands otherwise dominated by jack pine.  Most of these trees were likely removed during the logging era. Quercus ellipsoidalis (northern pin oak) is also locally important. Canopy associates include Acer rubrum (red maple), Betula papyrifera (paper or white birch), Pinus strobus (white pine, which occasionally occurs in the supercanopy), Populus grandidentata (bigtooth aspen), Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen), Prunus serotina (black cherry) and Quercus rubra (red oak) (Cohen 2002). Picea mariana (black spruce) may also occur, particularly where the system occurs on dune ridges within peatlands. Many former areas of jack pine and red pine forests succeeded to open “stump prairies” or scrubby forests of Populus grandidentata (bigtooth aspen), P. tremuloides (quaking aspen), Betula papyrifera (paper birch), and Prunus serotina (black cherry) following widespread logging and slash fires in the mid-1800s to early 1900s (Cohen 2002; Epstein et al. 2002).  Vaccinium angustifolium (low sweet blueberry), V. myrtilloides (Canada blueberry), and Gaylussacia baccata (huckleberry) are common low shrubs; characteristic dwarf shrubs include Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry), Chimaphila umbellata (pipsissewa), Cornus canadensis (bunchberry), Epigaea repens (trailing-arbutus), and Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen) (Epstein et al. 2002; MNDNR 2003; Cohen et al. 2015). In openings, Comptonia peregrina (sweet-fern), Prunus pumila (sand cherry), Salix humilis (prairie willow) and Corylus spp. (hazelnuts) may be present. On paludified sand ridges, species typical of peatlands, such as Chamaedaphne calyculata (leatherleaf) and Rhododendron groenlandicum (Labrador-tea) may proliferate. Characteristic herbaceous species include Pteridium aquilinum (bracken fern), Avenella flexuosa (wiry hair grass), Danthonia spicata (poverty grass),  Carex pensylvanica (Pennsylvania sedge), Aralia nudicaulis (sarsaparilla), Maianthemum canadense (Canada mayflower), Trientalis borealis (starflower), Mitchella repens (partridge-berry), Apocynum androsaemifolium (spreading dogbane), Eurybia macrophylla (large-leaved aster), Melampyrum lineare (cow-wheat), Linnaea borealis (twinflower), Oryzopsis asperifolia (rough-leaved rice-grass), and Piptatheropsis pungens (rice-grass) (Cohen 2002; Epstein et al. 2002; MNDNR 2003; Cohen et al. 2015). Mosses (e.g., Dicranum spp. and Pleurozium schreberi) and lichens (e.g., Cladina and Cladonia spp.) often form a mat on the soil (Cohen 2002). 

At Crex Meadows in western WI, Vogl (1961) studied pine barrens as described by original land survey records. He estimated that there were 20 trees greater than 15cm (6in) in diameter per hectare. This translates to an average distance between trees of 24m (65ft). The trees in this community had typical open-grown shapes. They had branches most of the way down their trunks with many needles. Many burned jack pine snags were encountered by land surveyors in Michigan. Zimmerman (1956) reported that the tallest tree in his 50 study sites was 16m (52ft). The average tree height was only 8m (26ft). This may be misleading because past logging may have eliminated the largest trees and there has not been enough time to regenerate the tallest pines. Vogl (1961), in his analysis of General Land Office surveys conducted in western WI, found that the average diameter of Pinus banksiana was 25cm (10in) and of P. resinosa was 50cm (20in). This indicates that taller trees may have existed before logging and the subsequent slash-fires that swept through most barrens.","Frequent fire and, in some places, frost and drought conditions, maintain open canopy conditions by limiting the development of woody vegetation and allowing the maintenance of a mixture of grasses and sedges. Pine barrens were found in the most fire-prone and driest areas of the landscape, often west of natural fire breaks. Barrens typically occur within long expanses capable of carrying wildfires with few natural fire breaks. In rolling topography, pine barrens are found in depressions that collect cold air, forming frost pockets (Comer 1996). 

Fire return intervals for stands in Minnesota are estimated at 30-50 years for moderate surface fires to 120-170 years for catastrophic fires (MNDNR 2003). 

There are numerous estimates of fire return interval for upland jack pine systems depending on scale and geographic location of study. Whitney (1986) estimated average return time for canopy replacement fire in jack pine forests of northern lower MI to be about 80yrs. Similar return times (50-100yrs) have been estimated by Heinselman (1981) in MN. Whitney (1986) also estimated that surface fires occurred every 25yrs, while Heinselman (1981) suggested that on drier sites light to moderate surface fires may have occurred every 20-40yrs. Simard & Blank (1982) calculated presettlement fire frequency in the Mack Lake area of Oscoda County, MI to have averaged in the range of 13-41yrs. Historical reports document near-annual fires in barrens (Curtis 1959). In a synthesis of the fire literature for historic fire return intervals for the Great Lakes Region Dickman and Cleland (2002) report that the fire return interval for jack pine barrens ranged from 15-60yrs and fires may have even occurred on an annual basis. It is likely that the frequency of fires depended in part to indigenous burning. 

Insect infestations in jack pine are also an important disturbance factor, often followed by canopy fire. Currently, jack pine budworm infestations can lead to stand-level mortality, but it is unclear how the insect behaved in presettlement. GLO data indicate that fire and windthrow were important in some barrens landscapes (Comer et al. 1995, Corner and Albert 1999). This system falls within Fire Regimes I and II.","This is matrix system that included prairie/barrens, savanna, and closed canopy forests. The patterning of these patch types was influenced by variation in the size, intensity and frequency of fires. Fire size, frequency and intensity was dependent on natural features, soil types, topography, climatic factors and the concentration of indigenous people.","Jack pine barrens often occurred on extensive areas of outwash plain intermixed with dry sand prairie and closed-canopy jack pine systems. The system grades into oak barrens and savannas in the south and into northern pine (oak) forests along to the north. It may be confused with Laurentian Pine-Oak Barrens (BpS 1407). 

Many areas that once supported pine barrens and closed jack pine forests have been planted to red pine plantations. Also, current logging practices, clear cutting of jack pine without fire or reforestation practices, these sites have converted to aspen and birch stands.
